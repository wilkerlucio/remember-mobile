(defn new-untangled-client
  "Entrypoint for creating a new untangled client. Instantiates an Application with default values, unless
  overridden by the parameters. If you do not supply a networking object, one will be provided that connects to the
  same server the application was served from, at `/api`.

  If you supply a `:request-transform` it must be a function:

  ```
 (fn [edn headers] [edn' headers'])
  ```

  it can replace the outgoing EDN or headers (returning both as a vector). NOTE: Both of these are clojurescript types.
  The edn will be encoded with transit, and the headers will be converted to a js map. IMPORTANT: Only supported
  when using the default built-in single-remote networking.

  `:initial-state` is your applications initial state. If it is an atom, it *must* be normalized. Untangled databases
  always have normalization turned on (for server data merging). If it is not an atom, it will be auto-normalized.

  `:started-callback` is an optional function that will receive the intiailized untangled application after it is
  mounted in the DOM, and is useful for triggering initial loads, routing mutations, etc. The Om reconciler is available
  under the `:reconciler` key (and you can access the app state, root node, etc from there.)

  `:network-error-callback` is a function of two arguments, the app state atom and the error, which will be invoked for
  every network error (status code >= 400, or no network found), should you choose to use the default built-in
  networking.

  `:migrate` is optional. It is a (fn [state tid->rid] ... state') that should return a new state where all tempids
  (the keys of `tid->rid`) are rewritten to real ids (the values of tid->rid). This defaults to a full recursive
  algorithm against all data in the app-state, which is correct but possibly slow).  Note that tempids will have an Om tempid data type.
  See Om reconciler documentation for further information.

  `:transit-handlers` (optional). A map with keys for `:read` and `:write`, which contain maps to be used for the read
  and write side of transit to extend the supported data types. See `make-untangled-network` in network.cljs. Only used
  when you default to the built-in networking.

  `:pathopt` (optional, defaults to true).  Turn on/off Om path optimization. This is here in case you're experiencing problems with rendering.
  Path optimization is a rendering optimization that may still have bugs.

  `:shared` (optional). A map of arbitrary values to be shared across all components, accessible to them via (om/shared this)

  `:networking` (optional). An instance of UntangledNetwork that will act as the default remote (named :remote). If
  you want to support multiple remotes, then this should be a map whose keys are the keyword names of the remotes
  and whose values are UntangledNetwork instances.

  `:mutation-merge (optional). A function `(fn [state mutation-symbol return-value])` that receives the app state as a
  map (NOT an atom) and should return the new state as a map. This function is run when network results are being merged,
  and is called once for each mutation that had a return value on the server. Returning nil from this function is safe, and will be ignored
  with a console message for debugging. If you need information about the original mutation arguments then you must reflect
  them back from the server in your return value. By default such values are discarded.

  There is currently no way to circumvent the encoding of the body into transit. If you want to talk to other endpoints
  via alternate protocols you must currently implement that outside of the framework (e.g. global functions/state).

  implementations as a general helper function.

  The named parameters can be specified any number of times. They are:

  - append:  A vector (path) to a list in your app state where this new object's ident should be appended. Will not append
  the ident if that ident is already in the list.
  - prepend: A vector (path) to a list in your app state where this new object's ident should be prepended. Will not append
  the ident if that ident is already in the list.
  - replace: A vector (path) to a specific location in app-state where this object's ident should be placed. Can target a to-one or to-many.
   If the target is a vector element then that element must already exist in the vector.

(defn merge-state!
  "Normalize and merge a (sub)tree of application state into the application using a known UI component's query and ident.

  This utility function obtains the ident of the incoming object-data using the UI component's ident function. Once obtained,
  it uses the component's query and ident to normalize the data and place the resulting objects in the correct tables.
  It is also quite common to want those new objects to be linked into lists in other spot in app state, so this function
  supports optional named parameters for doing this. These named parameters can be repeated as many times as you like in order
  to place the ident of the new object into other data structures of app state.

  This function honors the data merge story for Untangled: attributes that are queried for but do not appear in the
  data will be removed from the application. This function also uses the initial state for the component as a base
  for merge if there was no state for the object already in the database.

  This function will also trigger re-renders of components that directly render object merged, as well as any components
  into which you integrate that data via the named-parameters.

  This function is primarily meant to be used from things like server push and setTimeout/setInterval, where you're outside
  of the normal mutation story. Do not use this function within abstract mutations.

  - app-or-reconciler: The Untangled application or Om reconciler
  - component: The class of the component that corresponsds to the data. Must have an ident.
  - object-data: A map (tree) of data to merge. Will be normalized for you.
  - named-parameter: Post-processing ident integration steps. see integrate-ident!

  Any keywords that appear in ident integration steps will be added to the re-render queue.
